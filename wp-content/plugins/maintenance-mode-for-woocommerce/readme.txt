Maintenance mode for the Woocommerce Shop

== Description ==

The maintenance mode only puts the WooCommerce Shop into maintenance mode, but not your entire website. Decide for yourself which text or content should be displayed.

Possible reason for the "Coming soon" mode:
Your shop is not quite finished yet, but you want to show your visitors that a shop is about to open on your website.

Possible reason for the "maintenance mode":
You made an error while configuring or maintaining your products, and you can't find the error right away. Then switch your shop to "maintenance mode" and take your time to correct the error.

And the best thing is: it's free!
Yes, it's absolutely free. There is no premium version.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `maintenance-mode-for-woocommerce.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create a page and fill it with content.
4. You find the settings in the Woocommerce-Menu under "Maintenance mode"
